## Other Students

Am I tutoring you? Have I linked you to this repository for you to see my code as an example? The file structure of this repository might get slightly overwhelming, so here's how to find my .java source code files.

1. From the root of the repository (If you're reading this on the main page below the list of folders, that's where you are right now) click on the name of the assignment. For example, "Three Mini Programs"
2. Next, if applicable, pick the specific project from the assignment you're interested in. For example, "Initials"
3. Finally, to reach the source code of the project, click the folder labeled ``src/com/aayla``. There, you will find the .java source code files.
